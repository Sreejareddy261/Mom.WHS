  <h1>What is Mind Over Matter?</h1>
    <p>Mind Over Matter (MOM) is currently Whitney's only mental health club. It was founded in 2022, and it all started with a walk and talk between two friends. School was stressful. It occupied 3/4 of our life and there was barelyy any time to balance out my hobbies with academic school work. It was so bad that I looked like a ghost! I wasn't the only one who felt drained. It was a common occurence hear people brag of getting 4 hours worth of sleep. 4 hours. That's barely enough to keep a person functioning, a person requires a minimum of 7 hours of sleep a day. Keeping a routine of 4 hours of sleep a day was not only extremely toxic, it was ineffeceient in the long run. Health should alwsy be prioritized first becasue without a healthy body we can't do anything. </p>
